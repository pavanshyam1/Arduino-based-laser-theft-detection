# Arduino-based-laser-theft-detection
An Arduino-based Laser Theft Detection System is a simple yet effective security project designed to detect unauthorized access or movement in a restricted area using a laser and a light-dependent resistor (LDR). It is widely used in DIY electronics, home security systems, and educational demonstrations.
